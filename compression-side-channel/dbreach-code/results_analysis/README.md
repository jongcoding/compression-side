RESULTS ANALYSIS

This directory contaisn python scripts for processing and graphing the CSV files outputted by our
experiments. We used these scripts to calculate the optimal threshold for decision attacks and to
determine the accuracy of our attacks.

These scripts are not very polished and require editing to fill in the correct CSV filenames.

For detailed or custom CSV analysis, we recommend writing your own scripts / plotting logic, but
these are contained here for reference.
