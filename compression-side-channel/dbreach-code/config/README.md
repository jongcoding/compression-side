CONFIG

This directory contains example configs for MariaDB and MongoDB. These configs were similar to the
ones used throughout our experiments, although certain fields may have to be changed depending on
which experiment is running. (For example, you must set the compression algorithm in the MariaDB
config to switch with algorithm is being used).
